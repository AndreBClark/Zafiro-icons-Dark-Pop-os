### Zafiro icons 
zafiro icons is a icon pack for desktop xfce4 or lxde, with clean and simple design lines, inspired by flat desing. 
it is distributed under [L.I.M.A license](https://limalicense.com/getlicense/)
the priority is minimalism, we do not saturate elements with any icon,
each icon is given the time necessary to achieve a good job

*if you find any missing application icon please report it to me,

It is my knowledge that in the other categories there are some missing to add.*
